This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

To start, in the project directory you can run:

### `npm install` then ### `npm start`

This will download all the necessary packages and run the application itself.

To run Docker Compose - which will run the application above and the Cypress.io testing script, run:

### `docker-compose up` in the project directory
